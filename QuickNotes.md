# Challenge Notes

This is where I shall be jotting down notes on each concept I learn as I proceed through this challenge.

## Day 1 : Javascript Drum

* `keydown` event
* `HTMLMediaElement.play()` method
* `HTMLMediaElement.currentTime`
`HTMLMediaElement` DOM interface
* `transitionend` DOM event

## Day 2 : CSS + JS Clock
* I learnt about the `getSeconds` & `getMinutes` methods, which can be appended to `new Date()` to gets the currents seconds or minutes in that order.
